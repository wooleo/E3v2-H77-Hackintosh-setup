### Opening

> I built this Ivy Bridge setup early 2020 for scripting and video editing. Hackintoshing this setup is pretty simple, here's something you need to boot macOS Catalina using OpenCore boot loader. 

### Notice

1. I removed the UUID,MLB,ROM and Serial Number. You have to generate a new one with Clover Configurator, or you will not able to boot your device
2. I use OpenCore as my bootloader. You have to change your BIOS settings first, check the list below.

| Enable               | Disable                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| VT-x                 | Fast Boot                            |
| Above 4G decoding    | CFG Lock (MSR 0xE2 write protection) |
| Hyper Threading      | VT-d                                 |
| Execute Disable Bit  | CSM Support                          |
| EHCI/XHCI Hand-off   |                                      |
| OS type: other types |                                      |
